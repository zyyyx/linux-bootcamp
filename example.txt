Once upon a time there was a good programmer who used git. He committed
regularly and wrote useful messages.

One day, he wrote buggy code! But thankfully he was able to reset to an
earlier commit. Instead of having to rewrite his entire project, he was
able to just restart the buggy feature.

write an ending here

this is a really intresting story an I had fun reading it!

Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

Write an ending to the story!
